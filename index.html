        <h2>About my Ninja 400 Motorcycle</h2>
         <p>I named my Ninja 400 motorcycle as "Budz" because he is my buddy when riding.</p>
         <p>I am not new to riding but this is my first time having a sports bike so I decided to get this bike as my entry level bike</p>
         <p>Also, I like Kawasaki brand because it's my number one top choice and due to their durability, reliability, performance and easy to handle</p>
